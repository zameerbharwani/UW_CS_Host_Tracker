# UW CS Host Tracker
The following repository contains the scripts used to track the status of all the UW CS machines available for student usage.<br />
There are several machines available for student use, though the load is not evenly distributed.<br />
The data generated is hosted [here](http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~zfbharwa/uw_cs_host_tracker/), which it is recommended you use to choose your machine.<br />
 <br />
**Example ssh login** : ssh \<userID\>@ubuntu1804-<machine#>.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca.<br />
For example, *ssh zfbharwa@ubuntu1804-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca*
